Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  -The DriverPass project had us assume the role of a development team going through the steps of gathering information and planning the creation of a system for our client. Our client was the company DriverPass. DriverPass wanted to develop
  a website that allowed customers to register for an account, purchase packages, and schedule appointments to practice driving before their driving test. They wanted us to develop this system to meet all of their requirements that they 
  highlighted through several different documents. We then spent the next weeks learning about the process of determining the needs of different systems, and how to go about representing and planning the system that we needed to create.

What did you do particularly well?
  -One thing that I felt that I did well throughout this process was understanding and highlighting the requirements of the DriverPass system. I believe that I had a good understanding of everything the system was supposed to accomplish,
  as well as the different components that it would need to function properly. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -There are a few of diagrams that I created throughout the course of this course that I believe I could improve. For starters, making some of them look more presentable would help increase their readability. Also, there are some areas
  where I think I could have demonstrated certain relations or functions better in my diagrams. If I were to improve it, I think that I would review the different symbols associated for every diagram and ensure that I was using them properly.
  I would also spend additional time ensuring that I had included more of the smaller details as well.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -At the beginning of this project, we were given an interview document which was a conversation between the company and development team. From that, I was able to take the features that the company talked about and interpret the user's
  needs. This document helped to clarify exactly what they were looking for and the features that they needed. It is important to consider their needs because they are the ones who are asking you to create the system for them that can
  do what they ask it to. They are looking for a product that will help them in some way, so it is important that we understand exactly what they are looking for so that we can create the product that they are looking for.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  -When I design software, I take a ground up approach. I start off by determining everything the software needs to do. I then break it down into smaller pieces such as functions or classes that the program will need to accomplish its needs.
  I think mapping out relations and functions is an important step in this process, and there were several times where I had the opportunity to practice that skill in this class. Having a solid understanding of the final produce is essential
  before you start designing it.
